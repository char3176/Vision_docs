# Summary

These camera mounts are designed to be used with the Microsoft LifeCam HDâ€‘3000 Web camera on an FRC robot. (but can be used on anything).This camera normally has a heavy, rubber coated, hinged stand which is quite annoying to deal with when you use it in any way except on top of a desktop monitor. 

Update: as of Finals Match 3 on the Einstein Field, this camera mount was featured on "Optimus Climb" (created by The Beach Bots, Team 330), the 2016 World Champion.

2017 Update: During the 2017 season, we've made some improvements to the tab profile and made new adjustable mounts for this year's game. Some were used for testing and others were put onto the actual robot. 
FLIR_v1: Mounts camera flush against plane, designed to be tapped for #8-32 screw. 
FLIR_v2: Mounts camera at an 8 degree angle from plane, also for tapping a #8 screw
Cameramount_LEDS: Taller camera mount with curved slots to adjust yaw and two front slots to allow for LED holders. 
LEDholder: Holds two LED rings centered around the camera (such as these from Adafruit: https://www.adafruit.com/product/1463 and https://www.adafruit.com/product/1586) 
LEDholder_2LEDs: Holds 2 individual superbright LEDs

# Print Settings

Printer: Wanhao Duplicator i3
Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: No
Resolution: .2
Infill: 100%

Notes: 
Both mounts are designed to be printed on their backs. 
They have been printed several times without issue. 

# Post-Printing

The mounts require the original stand to be removed from the camera. This can be done by unscrewing the two small Phillips head screws in the recession on the back of the camera (they can be hard to see, you may need a light), removing the front plate, removing the screws on the PCB, carefully moving the PCB to the side, and removing the pin that holds the original stand in place. (allowing it to simply fall out)

The mounts are designed to hold the camera in place using a friction fit, but you could more permanently mount it using superglue. (at your own risk)
If you do not have a tight enough fit with the camera on the part you printed, try using some small pieces of electrical tape to increase the thickness of the tab.
